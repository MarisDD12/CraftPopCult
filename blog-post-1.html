                <p class="intro">Okay, can we talk about how satisfying it is to make something you'll actually use? I'm talking about potholders that don't just sit in a drawer - ones you reach for every single day because they actually work.</p>

                <p>This woven stitch potholder has become my go-to quick project. Whether I'm making a set for myself, whipping up a last-minute housewarming gift, or just need something mindless to crochet while watching TV, this pattern delivers every time.</p>

                <p>The best part? It's genuinely beginner-friendly. If you can chain and single crochet, you can make this. No complicated stitches, no confusing pattern repeats - just straightforward, satisfying crochet that works up in under an hour.</p>

                <h2>Why This Pattern Actually Works</h2>
                <p>I've tried a lot of potholder patterns over the years, and here's why this one is my favorite:</p>

                <p><strong>It's genuinely beginner-friendly.</strong> The woven stitch looks impressive and textured, but it's literally just chains and single crochets. If you're just learning to crochet, this is a great project to build your confidence.</p>

                <p><strong>The texture is perfect.</strong> That woven pattern creates a dense, thick fabric that actually protects your hands from heat. I'm not talking about those flimsy potholders that barely work - these are the real deal.</p>

                <p><strong>It's fast.</strong> Depending on how fast you crochet, you can knock one out in 30 minutes to an hour. Perfect for when you need a crafting win or want to make a quick gift.</p>

                <p><strong>One layer or two - you choose.</strong> I'll give you instructions for both a single-layer version (lighter, faster) and a double-layer version (extra heat protection). I usually make the double-layer ones because I'm paranoid about burning my hands, but the single layer works great too!</p>

                <h2>Let's Talk About Yarn (This Part is Important!)</h2>
                <p>Here's the thing about potholders: <strong>you MUST use 100% cotton yarn.</strong> I'm not being dramatic - acrylic and synthetic fibers can literally melt when exposed to heat. Not fun when you're pulling a hot pan out of the oven!</p>

                <p>I used Red Heart Scrubby Smoothie for mine, and I love it because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's 100% cotton (obviously!)</li>
                    <li>The texture gives you extra grip</li>
                    <li>It holds up really well in the wash (and trust me, these get washed a lot)</li>
                    <li>The colors are fun</li>
                </ul>

                <p>But honestly, any 100% cotton worsted weight yarn will work great. Here are some other options I've used and loved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Lion Brand 24/7 Cotton</a> - Super soft, comes in tons of colors</li>
                    <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Lily Sugar'n Cream</a> - Classic choice, affordable</li>
                    <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Bernat Handicrafter Cotton</a> - Nice texture, good color range</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How much yarn do you need?</strong> Each single-layer potholder uses about 50-75 yards. So one skein (usually around 200 yards) will make you 2-3 potholders. If you're making the double-layer version, plan on about 100-150 yards per potholder.</p>

                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> This is a GREAT stash-buster project if you have random cotton yarn sitting around!</p>

                <h2>Before You Start - Quick Tips</h2>
                <p><strong>Gauge doesn't really matter here.</strong> As long as your fabric is nice and dense (no big gaps between stitches), you're golden. I wouldn't stress about matching a specific gauge.</p>

                <p><strong>Size:</strong> This pattern makes a potholder that's roughly 7x7 inches. Want it bigger? Just add more chains at the beginning - make sure it's an even number!</p>

                <p><strong>Skill level:</strong> Total beginner? You got this. This was one of my first crochet projects, and it turned out great even with my wonky tension.</p>

                <p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> Set aside 30 minutes to an hour. It's the perfect project for a cozy evening or a Netflix binge.</p>

                <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
                <p>Let me make this super simple:</p>

                <p><strong>Yarn:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>100% cotton yarn, worsted weight</li>
                    <li>One skein makes 2-3 single-layer potholders</li>
                    <li>I used <a href="#" target="_blank">Red Heart Scrubby Smoothie</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Hook:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#" target="_blank">5mm (H/8) crochet hook</a></li>
                    <li>If your fabric is coming out too loose, go down to 4.5mm</li>
                    <li>Too tight and dense? Try 5.5mm</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Other stuff:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scissors</li>
                    <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Yarn needle for weaving in ends</a></li>
                    <li>Optional: stitch markers if you lose count easily (I definitely do!)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Looking for deals?</strong> I hunt down the best yarn sales every week - <a href="deals.html">check out this week's deals here!</a></p>

                <h2>Pattern Abbreviations</h2>
                <p>Just so we're all speaking the same language:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CH</strong> = chain</li>
                    <li><strong>SC</strong> = single crochet</li>
                    <li><strong>SL ST</strong> = slip stitch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That's it! Told you this was beginner-friendly.</p>

                <h2>The Pattern - Single Layer Version</h2>
                <p>Alright, let's make a potholder!</p>

                <h3>Starting Chain:</h3>
                <p>Chain 30</p>
                <p><em>(Want a bigger potholder? Chain more - just make sure it's an even number!)</em></p>

                <h3>Round 1:</h3>
                <p>SC in the second chain from the hook. CH 1, skip a chain, SC in the next chain. Keep doing this pattern (SC, CH 1, skip 1) all the way to the end. CH 1 and turn.</p>
                <p><strong>My tip:</strong> This first row creates the foundation for that woven texture. Don't worry if it feels a little fiddly - it gets easier!</p>

                <h3>Round 2:</h3>
                <p>Now here's where the magic happens. You're going to SC in the first chain space and in every chain space across. Yes, you're working into those little gaps from the previous row, not the chains themselves. At the end, CH 1 and turn.</p>
                <p><strong>My tip:</strong> Your stitches should line up vertically as you go. If they're looking wonky, you might be working into the wrong spots. No worries - you'll get the hang of it!</p>

                <h3>Rounds 3-28:</h3>
                <p>Just repeat Round 2.</p>
                <p>Yep, that's it! Same thing, 26 more times. This is the perfect mindless crochet - great for podcasts, TV shows, or just zoning out.</p>
                <p><strong>My tip:</strong> I count every 5 rows or so to make sure I'm on track. You can also just measure - you're aiming for about 7 inches square.</p>

                <h3>Finishing:</h3>
                <p>When you've completed Round 28, fasten off and cut your yarn, leaving about a 6-inch tail for weaving in later.</p>

                <h2>The Pattern - Double Layer Version (Extra Heat Protection!)</h2>
                <p>Want a thicker, more protective potholder? Make two!</p>
                <p><strong>Make the first piece exactly as written above.</strong> When you finish Round 28, fasten off and cut the yarn.</p>
                <p><strong>Make a second piece the same way,</strong> but here's the difference: <strong>Don't cut the yarn when you're done.</strong> We're going to use that working yarn to attach the two pieces together.</p>

                <h2>Adding the Border (This Works for Both Versions!)</h2>
                <p>The border is what makes everything look polished and finished. It's super simple:</p>

                <p><strong>For single-layer potholders:</strong><br>
                With your last stitch still on the hook, start working SC evenly around all four sides of your square.</p>

                <p><strong>For double-layer potholders:</strong><br>
                Hold both pieces together (wrong sides facing each other) and SC around all four sides, going through both layers at once.</p>

                <p><strong>The corners:</strong><br>
                When you get to each corner, work 3 SC in the same corner stitch. This helps it lay flat and look nice.</p>

                <p><strong>Closing the border:</strong><br>
                When you get back to where you started, slip stitch into the second SC from the beginning of your border round.</p>

                <p><strong>My tip:</strong> Take your time with the border. It's the part people see most, and a neat border makes even imperfect middle rows look great!</p>

                <h2>Want a Hanging Loop?</h2>
                <p>Super easy! When you've finished your border and made that final slip stitch:</p>
                <p>Chain 4, then slip stitch into the SC that's directly across from where your yarn is attached.</p>
                <p>Fasten off, cut your yarn, and weave in those ends.</p>
                <p>Now you've got a handy loop to hang your potholder on a hook in your kitchen!</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting (Because We've All Been There)</h2>

                <p><strong>"My potholder is getting wavy and ruffled!"</strong><br>
                You're probably working too loosely. Try going down a hook size (to 4.5mm) or consciously tightening up your tension a bit.</p>

                <p><strong>"It's curling at the edges!"</strong><br>
                Opposite problem - you're working too tightly. Go up to a 5.5mm hook or try to relax your grip. I know, easier said than done when you're focused!</p>

                <p><strong>"I lost count of my rows!"</strong><br>
                Honestly? Just measure it. If you're at about 7 inches square, you're good. Add or subtract a row or two if needed. Nobody's going to count your rows!</p>

                <p><strong>"The edges look messy and uneven."</strong><br>
                Don't stress! The border will clean up a lot of imperfections. I promise it'll look way better once you add that SC border around the edges.</p>

                <p><strong>"My two layers aren't staying together well."</strong><br>
                Make sure you're going through both layers with your border stitches. You can also add a few extra stitches in the middle by slip stitching through both layers before you add the border.</p>

                <h2>Taking Care of Your Potholders</h2>
                <p>Let's be real - these are going to get dirty. That's what they're for!</p>

                <p><strong>Washing:</strong> Toss them in the washing machine with your kitchen towels. Cold or warm water is fine. I do this at least once a week.</p>

                <p><strong>Drying:</strong> Tumble dry on low, or lay them flat to air dry. Cotton can shrink a tiny bit, but not much.</p>

                <p><strong>How long do they last?</strong> I replace mine every 6-12 months depending on how much I use them. When they start getting thin or looking worn, it's time for new ones. (Which is a great excuse to make them in new colors!)</p>

                <p><strong>Stain tips:</strong> Hot pads get greasy - it happens. Treat stains as soon as you can. I've had good luck with a paste of baking soda and water for grease stains.</p>

                <h2>Fun Ways to Customize This Pattern</h2>
                <p>Once you've made a basic potholder, here are some fun variations to try:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stripes!</strong> Change colors every 4-6 rows for a striped look. Super cute for holiday colors!</li>
                    <li><strong>Make a matching set.</strong> Potholders + dishcloths in the same colors = instant kitchen refresh.</li>
                    <li><strong>Try different textures.</strong> That scrubby yarn I mentioned? It adds extra grip and texture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go big!</strong> Want a trivet instead of a potholder? Just add more rows to make it bigger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gift sets.</strong> Package 2 potholders with a wooden spoon and a handwritten recipe card. Instant thoughtful gift!</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal themes.</strong> Red and green for Christmas, orange and black for Halloween, pastels for spring... you get the idea.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What to Make Next</h2>
                <p>If you loved this pattern, you might also enjoy these other quick cotton projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crochet dishcloths</strong> - Same idea, slightly different stitch pattern</li>
                    <li><strong>Face scrubbies</strong> - Perfect for the bathroom, same cotton yarn</li>
                    <li><strong>Coasters</strong> - Even faster than potholders!</li>
                    <li><strong>Market bag</strong> - A bigger project using the same techniques</li>
                </ul>
